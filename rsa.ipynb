    "This is a collection of functions that allow the user to encode and decode messages using the RSA cryptosystem. By providing two prime numbers and a message, this package will provide a public key, private key, and encoded message. The user can also then decode messages they receive using the provided private key. \n",
    "\n",
    "I go into more detail on the purpose of each function below, but as an overview: the basic tool set includes functions to first convert a message into a list of ascii integers, as well as a function to do the reverse. There is also a function to convert an integer to its binary expansion, however, I opted to use a different strategy. The first tool set includes a function for Fast Modular Exponentiation to calculate the modulus of a number raised to a very high exponent. We will review why this is much more efficient than using the built in exponential operator later on. The other function in the first tool set is the Euclidean Algorithm. This calculates the greatest common divisor which is then used in the Find Public Keyh E function to find an appropriate public key. The final piece of this puzzle is the function Find Private Key D. This goes through the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse used to decrypt messages. Finally with these functions in place, the user can use Decode and Encode messages.\n",

    "Working through this project, I was able to apply the various algorithms and ideas from Discrete Structures into a functioning program. In terms of coding, I learned that syntax is everything.

Everything from Fast Modular Exponentiation to the Euclidean Algorithm to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm was unlike anything I have ever studied before. Each step of each idea truly required me to thoroughly understand every concept beforehand. For example, to complete the Fast Modular Exponentiation function, I had to first grasp the concept of binary expansion and incorporate that into the algorithm. Working through the Extended Euclidean Algorithm was the most difficult task. Initially, it was difficult to keep track of the numerous variables and equations needed each step of the way. Fortunately, the mastery workbook along with Sriram's video provided some framwork to help keep everything straight.\n",

There was a lot of great discussion going on in Piazza as well. I admit I had not used Python for a while and needed to turn to Google for some reminders. The 'ord' function was one I had not used before. I also embarassingly kept trying to set up a loop using C++ syntax (i=0...) The best mistake I made was misreading the statement: \"Use GCD to find *e* which should be relatively prime to (p-1)x(q-1)\" I misread that final part of the sentence as \"relatively prime to (p-1) and (q-1)\" which is a very different idea.
